This was just a small test to try out the Scalos plugin-API but it is quite useful.

xtwindows.plugin currently has only two features:


1) When you press a qualifier while opening a drawer/file (ALT) the window is closed.

2) When you press a qualifier while closing a drawer (SHIFT) the parent-drawer is opened.


The qualifier isn't settable yet, but will be soon...  I'll probably add some other useful
functions too.
