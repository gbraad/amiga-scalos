V1.4
The functionality to wait until Scalos opens its first window on the workbench screen can now be suppressed with NOWAIT

V1.3
LoadWB now waits until Scalos opened its first Window on the workbench screen. This is to avoid problems with Birdie

V1.1
Added options: &quot;-DEBUG&quot;, &quot;DELAY&quot; and &quot;CLEANUP&quot;. They won't do anything, but it will make LoadWB.Scalos more compatible
