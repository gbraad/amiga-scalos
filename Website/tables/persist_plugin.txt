V39.24
Improvement: plugin now automatically reconizes when Scalos has finished starting up, and will start re-opening windows. Preferences variable &quot;StartDelay_Seconds&quot; is no longer used

V39.23
Improvement: Plugin is now able to store size and position of Scalos windows

V39.22
Improvement: Added support for browser mode windows

V39.21
Improvement: persist now skips opening any Scalos window if shift key is pressed

V39.20
Replaced dedicated code by new SCA_OpenDrawerByName library function (requires Scalos V41.x)

V39.19
Improvement: Replaced Assembler library startup functions by C code. No functional changes

V39.18
Improvement: Changed &quot;OpenDrawerByName()&quot; to make use of the Scalos iconobject datatypes

V39.17
Improvement: &quot;Persistant_Windows&quot; file no longer is deleted during initialisation. The advantage is, if Scalos crashed before the first window gets re-opened, the Persistant_Windows file is untouched. As soon as the first window opens, the Persistant_Windows file is rewritten.
Improvement: The re-opened windows won't get activated (works with Scalos V40.22+)

V39.16
Bugfix: Disabled some Printf() calls

V39.15
Improvement: Reversed order in which windows are reopened

V39.14
Improvement: Changed name of prefs file from &quot;ENVARC:Scalos/Persist.config&quot; to &quot;ENV:Scalos/Persist.prefs&quot;
Improvement: &quot;Use_SCA_Iconify&quot; now defaults to &quot;1&quot; if scalos.library version is at least 40

V39.13
Improvement: Name of persistant windows status file is now configurable in &quot;ENVARC:Scalos/Persist.config&quot;

V39.12
Improvement: When re-opening drawer windows, DDVM_BYICON now gets translated into IDTV_ViewModes_Icon

V39.11
Improvement: When re-opening window in iconified state, now immediately adds entry in persist file (no SCCM_Window_Open will occur, so otherwise no entry would be generated at all)

V39.10
Improvement: Prefs file may contain comment lines beginning with &quot;#&quot;. Empty lines in prefs file will be ignored
Improvement: Iconified windows are remembered and re-iconified on startup
