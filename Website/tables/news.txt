We are proud to present the first alpha version of Scalos for AmigaOS4! You can download the alpha version on the <a href="downloads.php#beta">Downloads page</a>. Due to the alpha status, there are still several restrictions:<br>- A lot of 68K modules/plugins are still present and not in a PPC native version.<br>- No patching is done of OS functions so there may be problems with updating certain information. Installation as a workbench replacement is disabled.<br>- Some code for the popupmenu is still disabled and so not all information is updated every time the popupmenu is opened.<br><br>We would also advice people not to report problems and/or bugs because they will most likely be ignored till a beta version is released.

Scalos beta version 40.21 has been uploaded. Visit the <a href="downloads.php#beta">Downloads page</a> as usual...<br><br>The very latest improvement is the asynchronous SCCM_DeviceList_Generate. This should take care of the problems some people have with Scalos hanging when started with an audio CD in the drive. There should also be less trouble with Samba causing Scalos to hang after disconnecting. However, the current solution is not yet watertight, there are still some timing windows when a no longer responding filesystem could cause Scalos to hang. As far as we know, those problems have been there since the very first versions of Scalos.
