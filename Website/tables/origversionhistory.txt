V40.30
New feature: Default icons may be drawn with adjustable degree of transparency

Improvement: When loading default icons, Scalos now adds information about the original object (Path+Name) for usage by the iconobject datatypes
Improvement: Made icon dd_Flags handling more flexible, so OS3.9 CD drawers open with correct viewmodes (WB handles invalid values of &quot;3&quot; like DDFLAGS_SHOWALL)
Bigfix: Scalos didn't handle default icons from icon drawer (e.g. def_drawer.info) correctly. Without separate DefIcons installed, only the icon.library built-in icons were used
Improvement: Added &quot;skip all&quot; gadget to standard copy/move &quot;replace&quot; dialog

Improvement: Added new ScalosControlA() tags SCALOSCTRLA_GetCopyBuffSize and SCALOSCTRLA_SetCopyBuffSize

Bugfix: FileTypes code assumed that popupmenu.library was open, leading to crashes on machines where that library was not installed

V40.29
New feature: Added full support for alpha channel icon drawing, including drag &amp; drop (&quot;Custom&quot; bob routines only)
Bugfix: Memory for default action in filetype descriptions was freed while not in use
Improvement: Filetype descriptions are now cached, in order to improve performance
Bugfix: Starting WB programs left 2 locks dangling
Improvement: Updated &quot;%os&quot; title function to recognise OS 3.5 and OS 3.9
Improvement: Made localisable string for &quot;BUSY&quot; disks

Bugfix: Optimisation of drag &amp; drop bobs was broken, leading to very sluggish drawing of bobs when dragging multiple icons
Improvement: Changed directory for Scalos filetype descriptors from &quot;Scalos:FileTypes/&quot; to &quot;ENV:Scalos/FileTypes/&quot;. For compatibility, Scalos still looks in the old place if the new directory cannot be found
Bugfix: In Text window, icon update erroneously changed type from &quot;WBGARBAGE&quot; to &quot;WBDRAWER&quot;
Bugfix: Fixed incorrect update of icons in text windows in &quot;view all&quot; mode
Improvement: To provide a visual hint that popup menu commands only apply to the icon under the pointer, all other selected icons are temporarily deselected while the popup menu is open
Improvement: Added keyboard qualifier to apply popup menu commands to every selected icon, instead of only the icon under the mouse pointer
Bugfix: Fixed long delay upon startup when splash window was turned off
Bugfix: selecting an icon in one window, then changing to another window, and hitting &quot;enter&quot; caused Scalos to crash with &quot;invalid semaphore state&quot; errors
Bugfix: Fixed several memory leaks associated with filetype-dependent popup menus and tooltips

Bugfix: In text view windows, Scalos had problems recognising default tool entries for project icons
Bugfix: Text icon IDTA_Type returned wrong icon type for WBGARBAGE (Trashcan) icons

Bugfix: Text windows didn't recognise window resize events during reading of icons
Improvement: Rewrote context-sensitive disabling of menu items
Added requester to ask user what to do when a project icon without a default tool is encountered
Added Polish catalog to developer archive, translation by Pawe¸ Szczodry
Bugfix: Fixed file count routine in filetransclass. The bug caused incorrect calculation of total byte/item count and lead to display of more than 100% completion with nonsense values for &quot;remaining time&quot;
Improvement: Removed display of every single item copied in filetrans copy/move requester. This optimization greatly improved copying speed
New feature: Added new method &quot;SCCM_FileTrans_OverwriteRequest&quot; for FileTrans.sca class

Bugfix: Fixed enforcer hits when CLI project icon contained no default tool
Bugfix: Cut &amp; Paste didn't work when AsyncWB was installed

New feature: Added SCA_ScalosControl() subcommand to get/free list of menu commands
New feature: Added new FONT and VALIGN attributes to TOOLTIP STRING
New feature: Added display of estimated remaining time to file copy/move progress dialog

V40.26
Bugfix: &quot;About&quot; produced 2 enforcer hits when no Scalos logo found
Bugfix: Splash resizing / text positioning was broken when no Scalos logo was found
Bugfix: Window process hung when one of the standard modules could not be started
Bugfix: Snapshotting a window which had no icon created an &quot;.info&quot; instead of an icon with the drawer's name
Bugfix: Windows with virtual width or height > 32768 could produce problems from graphical screen corruption to system crash
Bugfix: During file copy operations, icons could be overwritten without warning
Bugfix: TextInputHook wasn't used to run programs without an icon - instead, it always called execute_command.module

Rebuilt about window code to make use of the TT layout engine
Fixed bug in SCA_SortNode() - lists with less than 3 entries were not sorted

Copy/paste didn't work for volumes/disks - Fixed
Fixed another source for erroneous error messages during SCCM_FileTrans_Copy and SCCM_FileTrans_Move operations

LoadWB.scalos now waits until Scalos opens its first window on the Workbench screen before exiting
Now Scalos first tries to load deficons from &quot;THEME:DefIcons/&quot;. If that fails, the standard path &quot;ENV:Sys/&quot; is used
Now uses &quot;titlebarimageclass&quot; for iconify image if available
Changed all makefiles to work with GNU make
