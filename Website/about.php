<br>
<?php make_title('about', 0, 'about.gif', 390, 30, 'About Scalos development'); ?>
<br>
<p>As of 23rd November 1999, we took over development of Scalos, the Amiga Workbench desktop replacement. This followed a release by Stefan Sommerfeld stating that he would like a group of people with 
the right talents, abilities and resources to continue development. We are that group of people and we're gonna make Scalos the best Amiga Workbench desktop replacement there is!</p><br>

<!-- What is Scalos -->
<?php make_title('whatis', 1, 'whatis.gif', 230, 30, 'What is Scalos?'); ?>

<p>First of all, Scalos is <b>NOT</b> a replacement OS, although the name suggests otherwise. It is a desktop replacement for the Amiga. Want to see some of the features of Scalos? Simply 
<a href="features.php" target="mainframe">click here</a>. It is used instead of <a href="http://www.amiga.com/3.5/" target="_blank">Workbench</a> or 
<a href="http://www.gpsoft.com.au" target="_blank">Directory Opus Magellan</a>.<br><br>
The original Workbench gets older every day and is being left behind by other desktop systems. Scalos's original author, Stefan Sommerfeld, decided that there had to be something new, and so Scalos 
was born.<br><br>
Scalos's goal is to integrate a lot of additional functionality and an enhanced look without losing any of the look-and-feel we all love about the real Workbench. Yes, Scalos is like Directory Opus 
Magellan, but comparing these two isn't really fair. Scalos provides much better emulation of the real Workbench (&quot;the Workbench experience&quot;), and you won't notice any difference at first 
appearance. Because of this, we can't include a screenshot (look at your current Workbench for one!). Up to now Directory Opus Magellan just provides more functions.</p>

<!-- History of Scalos -->
<?php make_title('histscalos', 1, 'scaloshistory.gif', 280, 30, 'The History of Scalos'); ?>

<p>Scalos has been available to Amiga users for many years. It was originally written by Stefan Sommerfeld of ALiENDESiGN. His aim was to create an expandable, functional replacement for Workbench 
without losing any of the style and grace that we love about the Amiga. Stefan has since passed the reins over to us. We are now developing this exceptional software. Stay tuned!<br><br>
Some interesting info on why it's called Scalos... It was named after a planet from the original series of Star Trek (TM &amp; Copyright respected). Check out these links:<br>

<p>All Scalos updates will be available for free. We do not intend to make money from future Scalos versions.<br><br>
In V1.x updates, we plan to kill the bugs as soon as possible, but we also plan to add as many new, exciting, useful features as we can. Please see the <a href="features.php">features</a> page for 
more details.</p>
