<p>Please bear with us. We have received a lot of e-mail regarding the development of Scalos and it will take us time to go through each request/idea. Please be aware that whilst we will make every effort 
to ensure that as many ideas are implemented into Scalos as possible, we cannot guarantee that a particular idea will make it through. Not every idea submitted to us is suitable for everyone.</p>
