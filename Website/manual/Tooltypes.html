<P>
All icons are checked by Scalos for some special Tooltypes.  These allow you to customise the way some icons respond and look on your desktop.<BR>
<BR>
To add a tooltype to your chosen icon, right-click with your mouse, on the desired icon and select 'Information' from the pop-up menu.  This will display an <A HREF="Module-information.html">information dialog</A> based on the icon you had selected.  Locate the tooltypes section of the dialog and add any of the following:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>SCALOS_NODRAG</B> prevents an icon from having its last snapshot position from being altered.  When ever the user drags the icon from its current place, it snaps back to where it was last saved.</LI>
	<LI><B>SCALOS_NOTEXT</B> removes the text label showing the icons filename.</LI>
	<LI><B>SCALOS_NOTOOLTIP</B> prevents a tooltip appearing when the mouse pointer is left over an icon or file name (when viewing in text mode list).</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Drawer icons may also have the following tooltype to allow some more unique configuration:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>SCALOS_PATTERNNO=</B> can be used to assign a specific pattern number (assigned in the <A HREF="Pref_Pattern.html">Pattern Preferences</A>) to the window which opens upon selecting the drawer icon.</LI>
</UL>
