<P>
The Scalos desktop is built for easy expansion and upgrading without the need for hacky patches.  In the past Workbench has required heavy patching to offer new features.  Scalos' approach to this need to upgrade and extend is based on all of the following facilities...
<BR><BR>
<A HREF="Modules.html">Modules</A> offer external functionality, such as the Execute Command, Delete, Icon Information, Rename etc. dialog boxes.
<BR><BR>
<A HREF="Plugins.html">Plugins</A> allow the user to replace exisiting functions in the Scalos system, or, bolt-on new features to the existing system.
<BR><BR>
<A HREF="Arexx.html">Arexx</A> offers the non-programmer, or to be more precise: the script writers, a chance to interface and play with the features of Scalos without the need to open libraries and poke about for hours on end. 
<BR><BR>
<A HREF="Tooltypes.html">Tooltypes</A> bring a small amount of additional configuration to the overall dekstop.  Tooltypes are edited and controlled in a program or drawers icon (.info file).  You can use the <A HREF="Module-information.html">Icon Information dialog</A> to edit these tooltypes.
