<H2>Icon Information</H2>

<P>
To view an icons properties the Information window is used.  This is called from an icons context menu,
or from the screens Icon menu by selecting the "Information" menu item.  Note: The menu text may have
been renamed or moved if the system has been customised with the <A HREF="Pref_Menu.html">menu preferences</A>.
</P>

<P>
If no information.module file is installed in the SCALOS:Modules/
directory then the system will fall-back to using the traditional
Workbench icon information window. This also allows the possibility of
using a 3rd party, non-Scalos specific, icon information window patch
(available on Aminet).
</P>

<P>
We have noticed that on OS3.5+ systems
the use of the tradiational icon information window (rather than the Scalos
module) causes a number of enforcer hits which are un-avoidable due to the 
OS3.5 information window reading some undocumented structure fields in the
workbench.library base which are not supplied when Scalos is running.
