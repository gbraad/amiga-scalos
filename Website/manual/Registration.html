<H3><B>Scalos v1.x</B></H3>
All Scalos v1.x releases are <B>freeware</B> and no registration is required.  We do
not need to know how many people are using the ultimate desktop replacement, nor do
we want any money from you.  It would be nice if you subscribed to the user support mailing list (see below), 
this way we can keep in touch with the biggest amount of users.

<H3><B>Scalos v2.0 (future)</B></H3>
The v2.0 registration process has not yet been finalised.  It will however require some
form of payment.

<P>
One thing we do ask of users is to join the Scalos users mailing list.  This will
hopefully be a invaluable resource for all Scalos users.  You can share your problems,
ideas, and help fellow Scalos users.  The developers of Scalos will also try to keep a
presense on the users mailing list to help out and listen to the users requests for
features and bug reports.
</P>
<P>
To join the mailing list send an empty email to
<A HREF="mailto:scalos-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">scalos-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</A>.  
You will then recieve a confirmation email to ensure it really was you that
subscribed to the list.  Simply reply tothis and you will then be a new member of the
Scalos community!
</P>
<P>
Spam/junk email is not found on this mailing list so you will only find Scalos relevant
posts.  To remove yourself at a later date send an empty email to 
<A HREF="mailto:scalos-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com">scalos-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com</A> and you will recieve a confirmation e-mail before
being fully removed.
