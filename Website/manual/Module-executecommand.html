<H2>Execute Command</H2>

<P>
To execute a command with CLI parameters from the desktop you use the "Execute Command" module.  To launch the module you can either select the menu item from the Scalos-Screen pull-down menu;  Or use the keyboard shortcut <B>RIGHT-AMIGA + E</B>.  If you double click a file on the desktop which doesn't have an associated icon file (a file sharing the same name but with the additional ".info" extension), the "Execute Command" window will also be opened: and the name of the file you double clicked on is placed in to the string gadget automatically.
