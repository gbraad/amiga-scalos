Bastardised Hungarian Notation
==============================

1) Functions should have the first letter of each word in capitals. No crappy types for parameters
or return values, just the function name.

example:    void CheckMaxWidth(void);


2) structure names should be like AmigaOS structures - first letter of each word capitialised. The
fields in the structure should be in the form <tag>_<identifier> where <tag> is an abbreviated
version of the structure name. The identifiers will be named as listed below for normal variables.

example:    struct Blah {
				WORD    bl_wValue;
				LONG    bl_lSize;
			};

			struct Blah bl_Misc;


3) Identifier (for variables and fields of structures) names:
Variable name is constructued from <tag><identifier>. The identifier always starts with a capital
letter (the only capital in the name) and would probably be something similar to what you would
usually call the variable. The tag should have the type in it, and if it's a struct, should be
separated from the identifier by an underscore.

The tags to use are (bearing in mind the sizes of the AmigaOS standard types):

b   = byte (8 bit value)
w   = word (16 bit value)
l   = long (32 bit value)
i   = int
s   = short
f   = float or double
p   = pointer (can be combined with types by putting it in front)
o   = BOOL

The exceptions to this rule are variables like i, j, k, etc.

examples:		BYTE    *pbString;
			STRPTR  *pbStr2;
			int     iMaximum;
			float   fRadius;
			void    *pNothing;
