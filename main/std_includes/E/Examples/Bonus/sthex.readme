StHex translate string's characters into HEX value like ID=MAKE_ID(.,.,.,.) often used in C language.
So the ID used will be: CONST ID={hex}

Example and usage:

  StHex will ask you some text then it will convert it into HEX value.

Enter ID: MAIN
 M = 4d
 A = 41
 I = 49
 N = 4e

Result:
CONST MAIN = $4d41494e
