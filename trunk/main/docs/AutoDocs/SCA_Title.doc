    DESCRIPTION
	This class implements the screen title and window title functionality.


    TAGS
	SCCA_Title_Format (CONST_STRPTR) -- Format string for the title. 
	    This string is processed, replacing all the "%" variables 
	    with their values.

	    Standard title variables:

		"%os"	Kickstart release (e.g. "3.1")
		"%wb"	Scalos release (e.g. "1.3")
		"%ov"	Kickstart version (e.g. "40.68")
		"%wv"	Scalos version (e.g. "40.6")
		"%fc" *	Free chip RAM in bytes
		"%ff" *	Free fast RAM in bytes
		"%ft" *	Total free RAM in bytes
		"%pa"	Window's path
		"%df" *	Free disk space in bytes
		"%DF"	Free disk space, displayed in GBytes/MBytes/KBytes
		"%du" *	Used disk space in bytes
		"%DU"	Used disk space, displayed in GBytes/MBytes/KBytes
		"%d("	start: don't show if no disk inserted
		"%d)"	stop: don't show if no disk inserted
		"%dp"	percentage of disk space used
		"%cs"	Chip set
		"%cp"	Processor
		"%pr"	CoProzessor
		"%nt"	number of tasks
		"%nl"	number of libraries
		"%np"	number of message ports
		"%nd"	number of devices
		"%ns"	number of screens

	     Variables marked with "*" may optionally immediately be followed 
	     by a scaling modifier "0" .. "6" :
		0	Values is displayed in bytes.
		1	Values is displayed in KBytes.
		2	Values is displayed in MBytes.
		3	Values is displayed in GBytes.
		4	Values is displayed in TBytes.
		5	Values is displayed in PBytes.
		6	Values is displayed in HBytes.

	    Applicability is (IS).


	SCCA_Title_Type (ULONG) -- type of title

		SCCV_Title_Type_Screen -- Screen title (default)
		SCCV_Title_Type_Window -- Window title

	    Applicability is (I).

	SCCM_Title_Query

    SYNOPSIS
	BOOL NeedRefresh = DoMethod(obj,SCCM_Title_Query, UWORD ParseID);

    FUNCTION
	Check whether variable text has changed and needs to be refreshed.

    INPUTS
		ParseID - contains the two-character variable name, e.g. "os"

    RESULT
	NeedRefresh - non-zero value if title string has changed, i.e. 
		needs to be refreshed.

Title.sca/SCCM_Title_Translate

    NAME
	SCCM_Title_Translate

    SYNOPSIS
	BOOL Success = DoMethod(obj,SCCM_Title_Translate, STRPTR Buffer, 
		CONST_STRPTR TitleFormat, UWORD ParseID, UWORD Length);

    FUNCTION
	Processes one title format variable and generates expanded text 
	into buffer provided by caller.

    INPUTS
	Buffer - Pointer to a buffer where the expanded text will be stored.
		This pointer gets updated during method execution !!
	TitleFormat - pointer into title format string, immediately after the 
		variable name.
		This pointer gets updated during method execution !!
	ParseID - contains the two-character variable name, e.g. "os"
	Length - The number of bytes that fit into Buffer. Beware of writing 
		more than (Length) Bytes into Buffer!

    RESULT
	Success - a non-zero value indicates translation was successful.
		a zero value signals some kind of error (e.g. unknown 
		ParseID or insufficient Length).
