<P>
If possible it is highly recommended that you backup your old system before
installing Scalos.  Although no files are removed during installation of Scalos, it
is much easier and safer to know you have a backup of your working system should
anything go wrong.
</P>
<P>
Scalos installs its files in its own directory on your hard disk drive.  If for
some reason it fails to start-up correctly after a reboot, your old Workbench will
be run instead so that you may attempt to correct any problems.
