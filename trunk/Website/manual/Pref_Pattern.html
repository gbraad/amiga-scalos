<P>
With this program you can configure background pictures for the screen, desktop and windows.  It consists of two pages for your configuration.
<BR><BR>
<B>NOTE:</B> If problems should occurr with background pictures, please see <A HREF="FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</A> section.
<BR><BR>
Please ensure you have <B>no</B> Workbench backdrop pattern selected in the <B>original</B> WBPattern preferences program.  This is because Scalos uses its own pattern backdrop system, the patterns for the old Workbench will still be loaded but not seen by you, thus wasting your valuable memory.

<P>
The first allows you to compile a list of pictures, assigning a number to one or more of them for easy reference.
Using this number you will be able to assign the pictures to specific windows on the <A HREF="#defaultspage">Defaults Page</A>.
If multiple pictures have the same number, one of the pictures will be choosen randomly.  This will allow you to have random
dekstop pictures, random window backdrops etc. without the need for additional utilities/patches in your startup-sequence!
