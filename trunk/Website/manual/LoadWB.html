<P>
The new LoadWB command replaces the original.  The main difference is that it attempts
to launch the Scalos desktop by running the file <TT>SCALOS:Scalos</TT>.  Should the attempt
fail LoadWB will fall back to running the originally installed Workbench.<BR><BR>
When Scalos is installed, your original <TT>LoadWB</TT> command is renamed to
<TT>LoadWB.orig</TT>.  Then the new Scalos replacment <TT>LoadWB</TT> is copied to your C:
directory.  Should Scalos fail to start during boot-up the <TT>LoadWB.orig</TT> will be executed
as a fail-safe and *should* bring you back to your old Workbench.

<P>
Additional parameters are available for use with the LoadWB command - none of them are
necessary to everyday use of Scalos but are documented here mainly for completness.
A number of the parameters are dummies for OS3.5+ compatability.
<BR><BR>
<TT>SP=SCALOSPATH/K,ORIG=ORIGINAL/S,DEBUG=-DEBUG/S,DELAY/S,CLEANUP/S,NEWPATH/S,HIDE/S,SIMPLEGELS/S,SKIP=SKIPWBSTARTUP/S</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>SP=SCALOSPATH/K</TT><BR>
You must specify a legal directory path for the keyword.<BR>
Overrides the path to the Scalos installation which is stored in <TT>ENV:Sys/Scalos.prefs</TT>
<BR><BR>
<TT>ORIG=ORIGINAL/S</TT><BR>
Forces the old, original Workbench to beloaded rather than your current Scalos
installation.  This can be useful for times when something has reacted badly with Scalos
and you need to do some debugging via Workbench.
<BR><BR>
<TT>DEBUG=-DEBUG/S</TT><BR>
Currently only displays the version string of the LoadWB program.  It mainly remains to keep
compatability with the original LoadWB command parameter (which provided an additional Debug menu on Workbench).
<BR><BR>
<TT>NEWPATH/S</TT><BR>
Once Scalos has loaded, all programs launched from it inherit the its path
(which is the path that is set when you loaded WB duringthe s:startup-sequence).
Programs affected also include any Scalos modules.<BR>
<BR>
So if you wanted to add another directory to the path <I>after</I> Scalos
had loaded you'd open a shell (which therefore inherits the current path),
do a "path blah add" followed by a "loadwb newpath". Et voila, all tasks
now run from Scalos also have this directory in their path.
<BR><BR>
<TT>DELAY/S,CLEANUP/S,HIDE/S,SIMPLEGELS/S,SKIP=SKIPWBSTARTUP/S</TT><BR>
These are all dummy parameters which allow Scalos to be installed on a system which may
have been using these parameters with the original LoadWB command.  This should avoid
any errors during execution of the <TT>S:Startup-Sequence</TT>.  If you do not need
them when running you Workbench installation do not bother to specify them - Scalos' LoadWB
ignores them.
