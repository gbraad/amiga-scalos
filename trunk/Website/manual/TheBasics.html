<H3><B>Getting Started With Scalos</B></H3>
Turn on your computer and let it boot-up.  No messing, no hassle Scalos should
present itself just like your old Workbench installation did.  You may not even
notice any difference initally!
</P>
<P>
<H3><B>Using The Mouse With Scalos</B></H3>
Hold the mouse on a flat surface with the cable extending away from you so that
the mouse box rests under the palm of your hand with the buttons under your finger
tips.  The button onthe left is the selection button, the button on the right is
the menu button, and where available the middle mouse button allows you to pan
around the contents of a window.
</P>
<P>
<I>When using the mouse</I>
Pointing	means moving the mouse so that the tip of the pointer is positioned over an object on the screen.  The pointer moves inthe same direction you move the mouse.  The mouse can be lifted and repositioned at any time.  Lifting the mouse does not move the pointer.
Clicking	means pressing tand releasing the selection button
Double-Clicking	means clicking the selection button twice in rapid succession.  Double clicking on an icon causes a window to appear or a program to start,.
Holiding Down	means pressing the mouse button until your action is completed.
Dragging	means moving screens, windows, and icons by holding down the selection button and moving the mouse.

itself?

To start a program you double click the left mouse button on the
applications icon.  This should respond with a message in your screen title bar
If nothing happens you may have not clicked on the icon quick enough, try again. 
Do not click your icons many times at once otherwise you may be presented with
multiple instances of your chosen program!
