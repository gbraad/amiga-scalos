<P>
Scalos offers many new, exciting features, in addition to features you may
already be familiar with from using Workbench.
</P>
<P>
<B>Customizable interface components</B>  The common modules which make up Scalos can be
run in several different GUI styles.  This allows the user the choice of how their
system will look and feel.  Keeping consistency throughout the applications.
</P>
<P>
<B>Enhanced functionailty</B> The old functions of Workbench have been enhanced to offer
many new and useful additions making it easier and nicer to use.  The example the
Execute Command dialog now offers filename completion, ASL filerequester to select
files and much more (MUI version of module only).  Full details of all new additions to the common desktop
features can be found in the modules specific dosumentation.

it in the background increasing productivity!
