We've uploaded the DefIcons plugin. It's a replacement for the filetypes plugin and lets Scalos display a default icon for files without icons, depending on their file type. It requires OS3.5 or above. Get the plugin from the <a href="downloads.php#modules">Downloads page</a>.

I'm gonna rename this the &quot;Persistant Windows News Page&quot;! The persistant windows plugin has been updated again. Some minor changes to the prefs file, and now, iconified windows are remembered and re-iconified on startup.<br><br>Note from Juergen: Persistant_Windows files are *not compatible* with older versions, so all windows have to be opened manually after upgrading. Also, re-opening iconified windows currently looks rather ugly. I tried to use SCA_OpenIconWindow() with the SCA_Iconify tag but it seems to be broken, so I open the window just as usual and after 2 seconds, iconify it. Get the current release (V39.10) from the <a href="downloads.php#modules">Downloads page</a>.

The persistant windows plugin has been updated again. Removed enforcer hit when trying to open non-existent drawer. Also, it now tries to read &quot;ENVARC:sys/def_XXXdisk&quot; when requested to open window for XXX: device or the associated volume. Note that it does not yet read Scalos prefs or use the default icons path. This is planned for one of the next releases. Get the current release from the <a href="downloads.php#modules">Downloads page</a>.

The persistent windows plugin has been updated. It now checks for the existence of the device before attempting to open the directory windows. This should stop the requesters appearing if you had a window open on a device, but the device is no longer there. Also added is the ability to configure the delay between opening windows during boot-up. Get it from the <a href="downloads.php#modules">Downloads page</a>.

In addition to the above sub-domains, you can now access the online Scalos manual by going to <a href="http://manual.scalos.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://manual.scalos.co.uk</a>. Please note that this is not the final manual. We are currently fixing bugs and adding new features, so the manual is likely to change. There may be broken links in there, and I apologise for that, but I've tried to get it as correct as possible given our time constraints (most of us are at university, and are developing Scalos in our spare time).

We're currently testing a new version of the executable that has a number of bug fixes in it. We can't say any more, and we can't say when you'll get it, because it needs testing thoroughly first. We'll keep you posted though.

Seems to be the time for apologising... The recent upload of the preferences.library had buggy 020 and 040 versions. The 68000 version seems OK, but we'll test it a bit further. Please use the 68000 version or go back to a previous version of the library.

LoadWB and Preferences.library have been converted to 'C' language for easy updating and bugfixing. Work has begun on porting the assembler version of Scalos to the 'C' language now. It could take some time with over 560kb of pure source code for one file!<br><br>With summer holidays (for some) coming up, development could speed up a little too :)

OS3.5 icon support steps forward a bit more.
