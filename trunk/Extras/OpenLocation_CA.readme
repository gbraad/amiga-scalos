OpenLocation_CA v0.3 by Eric Sauvageau
--------------------------------------
This program will popup a GUI, asking you to enter the path of the drawer
you want to open.  If a drawer is specified as a WB argument, it will 
put this one in its string gadget by default (so you can put it in a 
menu, and define it as a "WB+Arg" command type in Scalos_Menu).

Uses ClassAct for its GUI.
