   Matrix picture, used with ScalosBeta installation script, is a screenshot(by Jean-marie COAT) of "Matrix" screen blanker.
The graphics (included in the "Matrix" executable released as freeware) were not entirely made by the
author(©2000-2002 Olivier Fabre - Email: off@free.fr).
The major part of them come from a BeOS screen blanker, whose author took them from a Linux version, and their legal
status is unknown.
